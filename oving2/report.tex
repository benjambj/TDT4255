\title{Exercise 2 - Implementation of a Multicycle Processor}
\author{Benjamin Bj\o rnseth}

\begin{abstract}
  In this exercise, we were to design and implement a multicycle processor. I
  made a design in which the processor is split into two pieces: the circuitry
  which performs operations on the register file and memory, and a control unit
  which drives the previously mentioned hardware. The control unit ended up
  having to use a larger number of cycles than expected per operation, due to a
  large amount registers being constructed from synthesis of the VHDL. The full
  design performs correctly in a simulated environment, but only partially so on
  the FPGA in which it was physically realized.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
The overall goal of the exercise was to make a multicycle processor
which could be included as a component in a peripheral on an FPGA
board. The way it was to be used once uploaded to the FPGA is shown in
\autoref{fig:communication}. The script, driver program and
communication module were provided, along with several other files
\footnote{The other files were a memory module, a register file, an
  ALU, a top level structural definition, a peripheral interface
  definition and an example testbench.}. Of these, only the
communication module was required to use.

In addition to the support files, we were also given a schematic for a
suggested processor architecture. This schematic is depicted in
\autoref{fig:suggestedArchitecture}. We were also given a suggested
instruction word format, shown in \autoref{tab:suggestedFormat}.

Our processor was required to support the following set of instructions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Instructions which use an ALU.
\item A memory-to-register load instruction.
\item A register-to-memory store instruction.
\item An instruction-to-register load immediate instruction.
\item A branch instruction.
\end{itemize}

To make my processor, I decided to use the supplied framework. My
implementation was also based on the suggestions previously mentioned,
with a few slight modifications I will get back to in
\autoref{sec:solution}. The challenge that was left, then, was mainly
to decide upon a cycle partitioning scheme for the execution of the
different types of instructions. I also had to decide on a more
specific instruction set, and adjust the instruction format based on
these decisions.

\section{Solution}
\label{sec:solution}
Blablabla general shit
Maybe tell about what I wanted to create here?

\subsection{Instruction Set}
\label{subsec:instructionSet}
The instruction set I decided upon is given in
\autoref{tab:instructionSet}. It supports the minimal set of
instructions required. As a branching instruction, I chose to
implement `Branch Not Zero'. {\bf MAKE UP SOME REASON
  HERE!!!!!!!!11}. 

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|p{190pt}|}
    \hline
    {\bf Pseudo-assembly} & {\bf Semantics} \\ \hline
    ADD/MOV/AND r{\em D}, r{\em A}, r{\em B} &  Performs the given operation on the values in register number {\em A} and {\em B}, and stores the result in register number {\em D}. \\ \hline
    LDI r{\em D} {\em value} & Stores {\em value} in register number {\em D}. \\ \hline
    LD r{\em D}, {\em offset}(r{\em A}) & Loads the value located at memory address $offset + value_{rA}$ into register number {\em D} \\ \hline
    ST r{\em B}, {\em offset}(r{\em A}) & Stores the value in register number {\em B} at memory address $offset + value_{rA}$. \\ \hline
    BNZ {\em address} & If the previous instruction did not set the status register of the ALU to zero, instruction fetching will continue from the content at instruction memory address {\em address}. Otherwise, instruction fetching will resume as if no instruction had been executed. \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{The supported instruction set. MORE EXPLANATION?}
  \label{tab:instructionSet}
\end{table}

\subsection{Instruction Format}
\label{subsec:instructionFormat}
My instruction format is given in
\autoref{tab:myInstructionFormat}. It is pretty similar to the
suggested one---the only difference is that there are no unused bits:
the func field is moved left, and the immediate field is extended. The
reason for this was that I thought the processor had access to 32 KiB
of byte-adressable memory, which requires fifteen bits to be fully
addressable. As each instruction is four bytes, a thirteen bit
immediate field would be able to be used as the address for {\em BNZ}
to access the full instruction memory if shifted left twice. These
assumptions about memory were not correct, though, and no such benefit
could be harvested. The immediate is kept this large anyway, however,
so that values from a larger interval can be used for the {\em Load
  Immediate} instruction. For the {\em BNZ} instruction, the eight
least significant bits of the immediate is used as an absolute jump
address.

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    {\bf name} & opcode & func & immediate & rD & rB & rA \\ \hline
    {\bf bits} & 31--29 & 28--25 & 24--12 & 11--8 & 7--4 & 3--0 \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{My instruction format}
  \label{tab:myInstructionFormat}
\end{table}

\subsection{The Processor}
\label{subsec:processor}
The schematic for my processor architecture is shown in
\autoref{fig:myProcessorArchitecture}. As can be seen by comparing it
with the architecture shown in \autoref{sec:solution}, this is not
exactly what I had planned on making. Specifically, there are quite
many more registers than I had wanted. The reason for this is that I
had a lot of clocked processes in my VHDL code to implement the
registers I wanted, while at the same time there existed other clocked
processes for signals going out of the processor and out of the
control unit. Consequently, signals took in some cases longer than
intended to propagate through the system. An easy solution to this
problem was to adjust the control unit, the consequences of which are
described in \autoref{subsec:controlunit}.

The program counter is a 32-bit wide register, which holds the address
in memory from where the next instruction is to be fetched. As the
memory modules provided are word-adressable, it is automatically
incremented by one at the end of each instruction execution so that an
instruction can be fetched from the next address in memory. In the
case of a branch instruction, however, we want to be able to jump in
case a branch is taken.  Thus, the input to the register is guarded by
a multiplexor, which chooses either the next instruction or the branch
target based on whichever is deemed appropriate by the control
unit. The control unit also controls writing to the program counter
with a write-enable signal, so that it is not continuously updated.

As described in \autoref{subsec:instructionSet}, the {\em Store}
instruction takes its value to store from register number {\em B}. The
reason for this is that the register file that was handed to us has
support for reading two registers and writing one register. When
performing the {\em Store} instruction, we want to use the ALU for
adding together the value in register number {\em A} and $offset$, and
as such the multiplexer in front of ALU input {\em B} will choose the
immediate value. However, if we circumvent the multiplexer by adding a
wire from the output of register number {\em B} directly to the data
memory value input, we can use the output from register B
anyways. Organizing it in this fashion makes register file access more
regular, as the same instruction fields can be directly mapped to
their register numbers without any cluttering access logic. This makes
the design simpler, and is thus a favorable solution.

\subsection{The Control Unit}
\label{subsec:controlunit}
My control unit operates as described in \autoref{tab:controlUnitStates}.
\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|p{40ptpt}|p{40pt}|p{40pt}|p{40pt}|p{40pt}|}
    \hline
    {\bf Instruction} & ALU-instruction & Load immediate & Load & Store & Branch not zero \\ \hline
    {\bf Cycle 1} & \multicolumn{5}{|p{200pt}|}{Update the value on the instruction memory address bus to the current value of the program counter} \\ \hline
    {\bf Cycle 2} & \multicolumn{5}{|p{200pt}|}{Wait for the requested value to be read from the instruction memory.} \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}

%We were given an implementation of a suggested structure of
%this peripheral. 

%Amongst these handouts, the only part we were
%required to use was a communication module. This module had the
%ability to read and write to memory as well as start the
%processor. The communication module would operate based on the values
%of some registers, set by a C driver program. Once on the FPGA, we
%could run the processor by first using a python script to send
%instructions across a USB connection. a C driver program would listen
%to incoming instructions pass instructions

%We weren
%handed several support files, amongst them VHDL implementations of
%components such as memory, a register file, an ALU, a communication
%module and a top level component used to glue together the different
%parts of the peripheral. The communication module could initialize and
%read memory as well as start the processor, and we were required to
%use it. This component, together with a C driver which was also in the
%handouts, was used for controlling the processor once uploaded on the
%FPGA.
